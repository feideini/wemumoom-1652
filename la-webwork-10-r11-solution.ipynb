    "There is a Central Limit Theorem for proportions as well as for means. We learned the one about sample means. This problem is about the CLT for proportions. If you have a population, such as all students at a university, and a population proportion; then taking samples of 74 students will give you many different sample proportions. These sample proportions have a standard deviation. According to the CLT, this standard deviation is $$\\sigma_{\\hat{p}}=$$"

    "Last year, we learned that the standard deviation of a binomial distribution is $\\sigma=\\sqrt{np(1-p)}$. If you have a population, such as all students at a university, and a population proportion; then taking samples of 74 students will give you many different sample proportions. These sample proportions have a standard deviation, which is the standard deviation of the binomial distribution. In our case, $$0.068=\\sqrt{74p(1-p)}$$"
