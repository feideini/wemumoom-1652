    "Consider the following problem on Lab Report 8: A survey of 77 students found that 42% were in favour of raising tuition to build a new recreation center. The standard deviation of the sample proportion is 6.6%. How large a sample (to the nearest person) would be required to reduce this standard deviation to 3.2%?"

    "This problem is based on the Central Limit Theorem for sample proportions (not the sample means). Just as with the sample means $\\bar{x}$, it makes sense to ask what the distribution of the sample proportions $\\hat{p}$ might be. The Central Limit Theorem for sample proportions tells us that the distribution for $\\hat{p}$ is approximately normal if the sample size $n>30$. The mean and standard deviation are $$\\mu_{\\bar{p}}=p$$ and $$\\sigma_{\\hat{p}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$$"
